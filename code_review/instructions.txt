Manual set-up:
In your deco3801 directory:
source /bin/env/activate

to activate the virtual environment.

Then go to kassdt/code_review, run 
python manage.py runserver 

to run the server

go to your web browser, type in localhost:8000 in the url bar
to go to the review. 

Automatic (from bash stuff) 
NB your .bashrc (note the preceding period) lives in your home directory (just type cd without anything else to go to home directory). 

deco - takes you to your repo kassdt/code_review, and starts virtualenv (you'll see (env) in front of your prompt) 

pm runserver - run the server

NB if you don't have your virtual environment running, your computer doesn't know about the existence of django.
